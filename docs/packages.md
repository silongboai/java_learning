## Understanding Packages

## Creating a Package

## Naming a Package and Naming Conventions

## Using Package Members
- Another, less common form of import allows you to import the public nested classes of an enclosing class.
- For convenience, the Java compiler automatically imports two entire packages for each source file
- Importing java.awt.* imports all of the types in the java.awt package, but it does not import java.awt.color, java.awt.font, or any other java.awt.xxxx packages.
- If a member in one package shares its name with a member in another package and both packages are imported, you must refer to each member by its qualified name.
- The static import statement gives you a way to import the constants and static methods that you want to use so that you do not need to prefix the name of their class.
