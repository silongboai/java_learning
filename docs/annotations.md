## Annotations
- Information for the compiler
- Compile-time and deployment-time processing
- Runtime processing

## The Format of an Annotation
- The at sign character (@) indicates to the compiler that what follows is an annotation: @Override
- The annotation can include elements, which can be named or unnamed, and there are values for those elements: @Author(name = "Benjamin Franklin", date = "3/27/2003")
- If there is just one element named value, then the name can be omitted: @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
- If the annotation has no elements, then the parentheses can be omitted
- If the annotations have the same type, then this is called a repeating annotation
